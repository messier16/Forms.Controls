## Installing this thing

Get it on NuGet: [Messier16.Forms.Controls](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Messier16.Forms.Controls)

## Using this thing

Make sure you call (as standard with most plugins) the following line in each and every of your client projects:

```
Messier16Controls.InitAll();
```

### Per platform nuances  
There are some specific things that you must take into account when working with the controls, find the details below.

#### Forms.Controls.iOS
##### For the RatingBar to work on iOS:
- You must provide a pair of images as image resources, you'll need one to represent an empty rating state and a filled rating state. I have provided a couple of them ([star.png](https://github.com/messier16/Forms.Controls/blob/net-standard/Sample/SampleNuGetApp/SampleNuGetApp.iOS/Resources/star%403x.png) and [star_filled.png](https://github.com/messier16/Forms.Controls/blob/net-standard/Sample/SampleNuGetApp/SampleNuGetApp.iOS/Resources/star_filled%403x.png))  but I strongly suggest you provide your own images to tailor the experience in your app.
- You **must set** the properties `FilledImage` and `Image` of the `RatingBar` object, to point to the previously mentioned files:
```
ratingBar1.FilledImage = "star_filled.png";
ratingBar1.Image = "star.png";
```

<sup>1</sup>It probably will give you a horrible warning, but it should work without issues.
